Serial Studio is a multi-platform, versatile data visualization tool designed for embedded engineers, students, hackers, and teachers. It allows users to visualize, analyze, and represent data from their projects and devices without needing custom, project-specific visualization software. Serial Studio offers a flexible solution that adapts to a wide range of use cases, making it ideal for both educational and professional environments.

The tool was born out of my experience in multiple CanSat-based competitions, where I often found myself developing new Ground Station Software for each project. Over time, I realized it would be more efficient and sustainable to maintain a single, flexible Ground Station Software that allows users to define how incoming data is processed and displayed.

Today, Serial Studio is a powerful and adaptable tool, suitable not only for CanSat competitions but for any data acquisition and visualization project. It supports data retrieval from a wide range of sources, including hardware and software serial ports, MQTT, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), and network sockets (TCP/UDP).

## Development

### Requirements

To compile Serial Studio, the only required dependency is [Qt](http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/), preferrably with all plugins & modules installed. The desktop application compiles with **Qt 6.8.1**.

If you're compiling on GNU/Linux, youâ€™ll also need to install `libgl1-mesa-dev`:

```bash
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
```

Once Qt is installed, you can compile the project by opening the **CMakeLists.txt** file in your preferred IDE or by using the command line:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake ../ -DPRODUCTION_OPTIMIZATION=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j 16 
```
