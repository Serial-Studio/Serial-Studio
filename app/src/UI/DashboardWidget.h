/**
 * @brief The DashboardWidget class
 *
 * The DashboardWidget class serves as a container and manager for various
 * dashboard widgets in a QML interface. It dynamically creates and manages
 * QQuickItem-based widgets (including QQuickPaintedItems) based on the widget
 * type specified by the UI::Dashboard class.
 *
 * This class handles the creation, sizing, and visibility of widgets, as well
 * as providing a consistent interface for different widget types to the QML
 * layer. It supports both QQuickItem and QQuickPaintedItem derived widgets,
 * allowing for flexible and efficient rendering strategies.
 *
 * The class also manages special cases like GPS widgets and external windows,
 * providing properties and methods to handle these scenarios.
